Pre-build hook scripts go here (executed before builds in this harbour).
- Examples: registry logins (Cloudsmith/ECR), secret/materialization checks
- Examples: policy gates, platform-tests, network-reachability tests.
- Ensure scripts are executable (chmod +x) and idempotent
- Order: files run in lexical order; prefix with numbers if you need ordering (01-*, 10-*)
