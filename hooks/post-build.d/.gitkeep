Post-build hook scripts go here (executed after builds, and sanity-tests, in this harbour).
- Examples: bash-spec specs, are available for all project types, policy gates
- Ensure scripts are executable (chmod +x) and idempotent
- Order: files run in lexical order; prefix with numbers if you need ordering (01-*, 10-*)
